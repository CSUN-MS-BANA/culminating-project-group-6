A. Time Series Analysis
	How do GDP per capita growth and employment rates change over time across different income-level countries?
	Can historical debt levels be used to forecast future government spending trends?

B. Hypothesis Testing 
	Is there a significant difference in unemployment rates between high-debt and low-debt countries? (T-Test)
	Do countries with higher literacy rates have lower poverty rates? (Chi-Square Test)
	Is life expectancy significantly higher in countries with greater access to clean water? (F-Test)

C. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) 
	How do inflation rate, trade balance, and public debt impact GDP per capita growth?
	What are the key predictors of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows in developing economies?

D. Classification 
	Can we classify countries into high-growth vs. low-growth economies based on GDP trends? (Logistic Regression)
	Which countries are most likely to default on public debt based on economic indicators? (Random Forest)
	Can debt-to-GDP ratios and employment growth be used to predict whether a country is a developed, emerging, or developing economy? (Decision Tree)

E. Clustering
	Are there distinct clusters of countries based on economic growth, public debt levels, and trade balance? (K-Means Clustering)
	Can clustering methods identify patterns of inflation and unemployment across different regions?
	How do developed and developing countries cluster based on social indicators like literacy rate and life expectancy?

F. Neural Networks
	Can a neural network model predict GDP growth more accurately than a traditional regression model?
	Can a neural network predict a countryâ€™s likelihood of falling into a financial crisis based on debt indicators?
	How accurately can a neural network forecast employment growth based on past labor market trends?
